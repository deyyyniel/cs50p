# [Emojize](#emojize)

Because emoji aren’t quite as easy to type as text, at least on laptops
and desktops, some programs support “codes,” whereby you can type, for
instance, `:thumbs_up:`, which will be automatically converted to
👍. Some
programs additionally support aliases, whereby you can more succinctly
type, for instance, `:thumbsup:`, which will also be automatically
converted to 👍.

See
[carpedm20.github.io/emoji/all.html?enableList=enable_list_alias](https://carpedm20.github.io/emoji/all.html?enableList=enable_list_alias)
for a list of codes with aliases.

In a file called `emojize.py`, implement a program that prompts the user
for a `str` in English and then outputs the “emojized” version of that
`str`, converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding
emoji.

Hints

- Note that the `emoji` module comes with two functions, per
  [pypi.org/project/emoji](https://pypi.org/project/emoji/), one of
  which is `emojize`, which takes an optional, named parameter called
  `language`. You can install it with:

  ``` highlight
  pip install emoji
  ```

## [Demo](#demo)

``` highlight
$ python emojize.py
Input: :thumbs_up:
Output: 👍
$ python emojize.py
Input: :thumbsup:
Output: 👍
$ python emojize.py
Input: hello, :earth_africa:
Output: hello, 🌍
$ python emojize.py
Input: hello, :earth_americas:
Output: hello, 🌎
$ python emojize.py
Input: hello, :earth_asia:
Output: hello, 🌏
$
```

## [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin)

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window,
and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s
prompt resembles the below:

``` highlight
$
```

Next execute

``` highlight
mkdir emojize
```

to make a folder called `emojize` in your codespace.

Then execute

``` highlight
cd emojize
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal
prompt as `emojize/ $`. You can now execute

``` highlight
code emojize.py
```

to make a file called `emojize.py` where you’ll write your program.

## [How to Test](#how-to-test)

Here’s how to test your code manually:

- Run your program with `python emojize.py`. Type `:1st_place_medal:`
  and press Enter. Your program should output:

  ``` highlight
  Output:
  ```

- Run your program with `python emojize.py`. Type `:money_bag:` and
  press Enter. Your program should output:

  ``` highlight
  Output:
  ```

- Run your program with `python emojize.py`. Type `:smile_cat:` and
  press Enter. Your program should output:

  ``` highlight
  Output:
  ```

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program
that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to
test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/emojize
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

``` highlight
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/emojize
```
