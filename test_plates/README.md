# [Re-requesting a Vanity Plate](#re-requesting-a-vanity-plate)

In a file called `plates.py`, reimplement [Vanity
Plates](../../2/plates/) from [Problem Set 2](../../2/), restructuring
your code per the below, wherein `is_valid` still expects a `str` as
input and returns `True` if that `str` meets all requirements and
`False` if it does not, but `main` is only called if the value of
`__name__` is `"__main__"`:

``` py
def main():
    ...


def is_valid(s):
    ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Then, in a file called `test_plates.py`, implement **four or more**
functions that collectively test your implementation of `is_valid`
thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with `test_` so that you
can execute your tests with:

``` highlight
pytest test_plates.py
```

Hints

- Be sure to include

  ``` py
  import plates
  ```

  or

  ``` py
  from plates import is_valid
  ```

  atop `test_plates.py` so that you can call `is_valid` in your tests.

- Take care to `return`, not `print`, a `bool` in `is_valid`. Only
  `main` should call `print`.

## [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin)

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window,
and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s
prompt resembles the below:

``` highlight
$
```

Next execute

``` highlight
mkdir test_plates
```

to make a folder called `test_plates` in your codespace.

Then execute

``` highlight
cd test_plates
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal
prompt as `test_plates/ $`. You can now execute

``` highlight
code test_plates.py
```

to make a file called `test_plates.py` where you’ll write your tests.

## [How to Test](#how-to-test)

To test your tests, run `pytest test_plates.py`. Be sure you have a copy
of a `plates.py` file in the same folder. Try to use correct and
incorrect versions of `plates.py` to determine how well your tests spot
errors:

- Ensure you have a correct version of `plates.py`. Run your tests by
  executing `pytest test_plates.py`. `pytest` should show that all of
  your tests have passed.
- Modify the correct version of `plates.py`, perhaps eliminating some of
  its constraints. Your program might, for example, mistakenly print
  “Valid” for a license plate of any length! Run your tests by executing
  `pytest test_plates.py`. `pytest` should show that at least one of
  your tests has failed.

You can execute the below to check your tests using `check50`, a program
CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. (Now there are tests to
test your tests!). Be sure to test your tests yourself and determine
which tests are needed to ensure `plates.py` is checked thoroughly.

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/tests/plates
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

``` highlight
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/tests/plates
```
