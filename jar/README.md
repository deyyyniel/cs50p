Suppose that you‚Äôd like to implement a [cookie
jar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_jar) in which to store
cookies. In a file called `jar.py`, implement a `class` called `Jar`
with these methods:

- `__init__` should initialize a cookie jar
    with the given `capacity`, which represents the maximum number of
    cookies that can fit in the cookie jar. If `capacity` is not a
    non-negative `int`, though, `__init__` should instead raise a
    `ValueError`.
- `__str__` should return a `str` with *n*
    <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/1f36a.png"
    class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üç™" />, where *n* is the number
    of cookies in the cookie jar. For instance, if there are 3 cookies
    in the cookie jar, then `str` should return
    `"`<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/1f36a.png"
    class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üç™" /><img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/1f36a.png"
    class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üç™" /><img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/1f36a.png"
    class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üç™" />`"`
- `deposit` should add `n` cookies to the
    cookie jar. If adding that many would exceed the cookie jar‚Äôs
    capacity, though, `deposit` should instead raise a `ValueError`.
- `withdraw` should remove `n` cookies from
    the cookie jar. Nom nom nom. If there aren‚Äôt that many cookies in
    the cookie jar, though, `withdraw` should instead raise a
    `ValueError`.
- `capacity` should return the cookie jar‚Äôs
    capacity.
- `size` should return the number of
    cookies actually in the cookie jar, initially `0`.

Structure your `class` per the below. You may not alter these methods‚Äô
parameters, but you may add your own methods.

``` highlight
class Jar:
    def __init__(self, capacity=12):
        ...

    def __str__(self):
        ...

    def deposit(self, n):
        ...

    def withdraw(self, n):
        ...

    @property
    def capacity(self):
        ...

    @property
    def size(self):
        ...
```

Either before or after you implement `jar.py`, additionally implement,
in a file called `test_jar.py`, **four or more** functions that
collectively test your implementation of `Jar` thoroughly, each of whose
names should begin with `test_` so that you can execute your tests with:

``` highlight
pytest test_jar.py
```

Note that it‚Äôs not as easy to test instance methods as it is to test
functions alone, since instance methods sometimes manipulate the same
‚Äústate‚Äù (i.e., instance variables). To test one method (e.g.,
`withdraw`), then, you might need to call another method first (e.g.,
`deposit`). But the method you call first might itself not be correct!

And so programmers sometimes
[mock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) (i.e., simulate) state
when testing methods, as with Python‚Äôs own [mock object
library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html), so that
you can call just the one method but modify the underlying state first,
without calling the other method to do so.

For simplicity, though, no need to mock any state. Implement your tests
as you normally would!

Hints

``` python
from jar import Jar


def test_init():
    ...


def test_str():
    jar = Jar()
    assert str(jar) == ""
    jar.deposit(1)
    assert str(jar) == ""
    jar.deposit(11)
    assert str(jar) == ""


def test_deposit():
    ...


def test_withdraw():
    ...
```

## [Demo](#demo)

You‚Äôre welcome, but not required, to implement a `main` function, so
this is all we can demo!

## [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin)

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window,
and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window‚Äôs
prompt resembles the below:

``` highlight
$
```

Next execute

``` highlight
mkdir jar
```

to make a folder called `jar` in your codespace.

Then execute

``` highlight
cd jar
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal
prompt as `jar/ $`. You can now execute

``` highlight
code jar.py
```

to make a file called `jar.py` where you‚Äôll write your program. You can
also execute

``` highlight
code test_jar.py
```

to create a file called `test_jar.py` where you can write tests for your
program.

## [How to Test](#how-to-test)

Here‚Äôs how to test your code manually:

- Open your `test_jar.py` file and import
    your `Jar` class with `from jar import Jar`. Create a function
    called `test_init`, wherein you create a new instance of `Jar` with
    `jar = Jar()`. `assert` that this jar has the capacity it should,
    then run your tests with `pytest test_jar.py`.
- Add another function to your
    `test_jar.py` file called `test_str`. In `test_str`, create a new
    instance of your `Jar` class and `deposit` a few cookies. `assert`
    that `str(jar)` prints out as many cookies as have been `deposit`ed,
    then run your tests with `pytest test_jar.py`.
- Add another function to your
    `test_jar.py` file called `test_deposit`. In `test_deposit`, create
    a new instance of your `Jar` class and `deposit` a few cookies.
    `assert` that the jar‚Äôs `size` attribute is as large as the number
    of cookies that have been `deposit`ed. Also `assert` that, if you
    deposit more than the jar‚Äôs `capacity`, `deposit` should raise a
    `ValueError`. Run your tests with `pytest test_jar.py`.
- Add another function to your
    `test_jar.py` file called `test_withdraw`. In `test_withdraw`,
    create a new instance of your `Jar` class and first `deposit` a few
    cookies. `assert` that `withdraw`ing from the jar leaves the
    appropriate number of cookies in the jar‚Äôs `size` attribute. Also
    `assert` that, if you withdraw more than the jar‚Äôs `size`,
    `withdraw` should raise a `ValueError`. Run your tests with
    `pytest test_jar.py`.

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program
that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to
test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/jar
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

``` highlight
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/jar
```
