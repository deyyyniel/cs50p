# [Refueling](#refueling)

In a file called `fuel.py`, reimplement [Fuel Gauge](../../3/fuel/) from
[Problem Set 3](../../3/), restructuring your code per the below,
wherein:

- `convert` expects a `str` in `X/Y` format as input, wherein each of
  `X` and `Y` is an integer, and returns that fraction as a percentage
  rounded to the nearest `int` between `0` and `100`, inclusive. If `X`
  and/or `Y` is not an integer, or if `X` is greater than `Y`, then
  `convert` should raise a `ValueError`. If `Y` is `0`, then `convert`
  should raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
- `gauge` expects an `int` and returns a `str` that is:
  - `"E"` if that `int` is less than or equal to `1`,
  - `"F"` if that `int` is greater than or equal to `99`,
  - and `"Z%"` otherwise, wherein `Z` is that same `int`.

``` py
def main():
    ...


def convert(fraction):
    ...


def gauge(percentage):
    ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Then, in a file called `test_fuel.py`, implement **two or more**
functions that collectively test your implementations of `convert` and
`gauge` thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with `test_` so
that you can execute your tests with:

``` highlight
pytest test_fuel.py
```

Hints

- Be sure to include

  ``` py
  import fuel
  ```

  or

  ``` py
  from fuel import convert, gauge
  ```

  atop `test_fuel.py` so that you can call `convert` and `gauge` in your
  tests.

- Take care to `return`, not `print`, an `int` in `convert` and a `str`
  in `gauge`. Only `main` should call `print`.

- Note that you can check with `pytest` whether a function has raised an
  exception, per
  [docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/assert.html#assertions-about-expected-exceptions](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/assert.html#assertions-about-expected-exceptions).

## [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin)

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window,
and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s
prompt resembles the below:

``` highlight
$
```

Next execute

``` highlight
mkdir test_fuel
```

to make a folder called `test_fuel` in your codespace.

Then execute

``` highlight
cd test_fuel
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal
prompt as `test_fuel/ $`. You can now execute

``` highlight
code test_fuel.py
```

to make a file called `test_fuel.py` where you’ll write your tests.

## [How to Test](#how-to-test)

To test your tests, run `pytest test_fuel.py`. Be sure you have a copy
of a `fuel.py` file in the same folder. Try to use correct and incorrect
versions of `fuel.py` to determine how well your tests spot errors:

- Ensure you have a correct version of `fuel.py`. Run your tests by
  executing `pytest test_fuel.py`. `pytest` should show that all of your
  tests have passed.
- Modify the correct version of `fuel.py`, changing the return values of
  `convert`. Your program might, for example, mistakenly return a `str`
  instead of an `int`. Run your tests by executing
  `pytest test_fuel.py`. `pytest` should show that at least one of your
  tests has failed.
- Similarly, modify the correct version of `fuel.py`, changing the
  return values of `gauge`. Your program might, for example, mistakenly
  omit a `%` in the resulting `str`. Run your tests by executing
  `pytest test_fuel.py`. `pytest` should show that at least one of your
  tests has failed.

You can execute the below to check your tests using `check50`, a program
CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. (Now there are tests to
test your tests!). Be sure to test your tests yourself and determine
which tests are needed to ensure `fuel.py` is checked thoroughly.

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/tests/fuel
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

``` highlight
