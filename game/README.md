# [Guessing Game](#guessing-game)

I’m thinking of a number between 1 and 100…

What is it?

It’s 50! But what if it were more random?

In a file called `game.py`, implement a program that:

- Prompts the user for a level, $n$. If the user does not input a
  positive integer, the program should prompt again.
- Randomly generates an integer between 1 and $n$, inclusive, using the
  `random` module.
- Prompts the user to guess that integer. If the guess is not a positive
  integer, the program should prompt the user again.
  - If the guess is smaller than that integer, the program should output
    `Too small!` and prompt the user again.
  - If the guess is larger than that integer, the program should output
    `Too large!` and prompt the user again.
  - If the guess is the same as that integer, the program should output
    `Just right!` and exit.

Hints

- Note that the `random` module comes with quite a few functions, per
  [docs.python.org/3/library/random.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html).

## [Demo](#demo)

``` highlight
$ python game.py
Level: 1
Guess: 1
Just right!
$ python game.py
Level: 10
Guess: 5
Too large!
Guess: 3
Just right!
$ python game.py
Level: cat
Level: 10
Guess: cat
Guess: dog
Guess: 5
Too large!
Guess: 2
Too small!
Guess: 3
Just right!
$
```

## [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin)

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window,
and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s
prompt resembles the below:

``` highlight
$
```

Next execute

``` highlight
mkdir game
```

to make a folder called `game` in your codespace.

Then execute

``` highlight
cd game
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal
prompt as `game/ $`. You can now execute

``` highlight
code game.py
```

to make a file called `game.py` where you’ll write your program.

## [How to Test](#how-to-test)

Here’s how to test your code manually:

- Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `cat` at a prompt that
  says `Level:` and press Enter. Your program should reprompt you:

  ``` highlight
  Level:
  ```

- Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `-1` at a prompt that
  says `Level:` and press Enter. Your program should reprompt you:

  ``` highlight
  Level:
  ```

- Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `10` at a prompt that
  says `Level:` and press Enter. Your program should now be ready to
  accept guesses:

  ``` highlight
  Guess:
  ```

- Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `10` at a prompt that
  says `Level:` and press Enter. Then type `cat`. Your program should
  reprompt you:

  ``` highlight
  Guess:
  ```

- Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `10` at a prompt that
  says `Level:` and press Enter. Then type `-1`. Your program should
  reprompt you:

  ``` highlight
  Guess:
  ```

- Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `1` at a prompt that says
  `Level:` and press Enter. Then type `1`. Your program should output:

  ``` highlight
  Just right!
  ```

  There’s only one possible number the answer could be!

- Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `10` at a prompt that
  says `Level:` and press Enter. Then type `100`. Your program should
  output:

  ``` highlight
  Too large!
  ```

  Looks like you’re guessing outside the range you specified.

- Run your program with `python game.py`. Type `10000` at a prompt that
  says `Level:` and press Enter. Then type `1`. Your program should
  output:

  ``` highlight
  Too small!
  ```

  Most likely, anyways: you might get lucky and see `Just right!`. But
  it would certainly be odd for you to see `Just right!` every time. And
  certainly you shouldn’t see `Too large!`.

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program
that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to
test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/game
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.
