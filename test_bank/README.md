# [Back to the Bank](#back-to-the-bank)

In a file called `bank.py`, reimplement [Home Federal Savings
Bank](../../1/bank/) from [Problem Set 1](../../1/), restructuring your
code per the below, wherein `value` expects a `str` as input and returns
`0` if that `str` starts with “hello”, `20` if that `str` starts with an
“h” (but not “hello”), or `100` otherwise, treating the `str`
case-insensitively. You can assume that the string passed to the `value`
function will not contain any leading spaces. Only `main` should call
`print`.

``` py
def main():
    ...


def value(greeting):
    ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Then, in a file called `test_bank.py`, implement **three or more**
functions that collectively test your implementation of `value`
thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with `test_` so that you
can execute your tests with:

``` highlight
pytest test_bank.py
```

Hints

- Be sure to include

  ``` highlight
  import bank
  ```

  or

  ``` highlight
  from bank import value
  ```

  atop `test_bank.py` so that you can call `value` in your tests.

- Take care to `return`, not `print`, an `int` in `value`. Only `main`
  should call `print`.

## [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin)

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window,
and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s
prompt resembles the below:

``` highlight
$
```

Next execute

``` highlight
mkdir test_bank
```

to make a folder called `test_bank` in your codespace.

Then execute

``` highlight
cd test_bank
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal
prompt as `test_bank/ $`. You can now execute

``` highlight
code test_bank.py
```

to make a file called `test_bank.py` where you’ll write your tests.

## [How to Test](#how-to-test)

To test your tests, run `pytest test_bank.py`. Be sure you have a copy
of a `bank.py` file in the same folder. Try to use correct and incorrect
versions of `bank.py` to determine how well your tests spot errors:

- Ensure you have a correct version of `bank.py`. Run your tests by
  executing `pytest test_bank.py`. `pytest` should show that all of your
  tests have passed.
- Modify the correct version of `bank.py`, changing the values provided
  for each greeting. Your program might, for example, mistakenly provide
  \$100 to a customer greeted by “Hello” and \$0 to a customer greeted
  with “What’s up”! Now, run your tests by executing
  `pytest test_bank.py`. `pytest` should show that at least one of your
  tests has failed.

You can execute the below to check your tests using `check50`, a program
CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. (Now there are tests to
test your tests!). Be sure to test your tests yourself and determine
which tests are needed to ensure `bank.py` is checked thoroughly.

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/tests/bank
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

``` highlight
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/tests/bank
```
