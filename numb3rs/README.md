# [NUMB3RS](#numb3rs)

In Season 5, Episode 23 of
[NUMB3RS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_(TV_series)), a supposed
[IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) appears on
screen, `275.3.6.28`, which isn’t actually a valid
[IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) (or
[IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6)) address.

An IPv4 address is a numeric identifier that a device (or, on TV,
hacker) uses to communicate on the internet, akin to a postal address in
the real world, typically formatted in [dot-decimal
notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-decimal_notation) as
`#.#.#.#`. But each `#` should be a number between `0` and `255`,
inclusive. Suffice it to say `275` is not in that range! If only NUMB3RS
had validated the address in that scene!

In a file called `numb3rs.py`, implement a function called `validate`
that expects an IPv4 address as input as a `str` and then returns `True`
or `False`, respectively, if that input is a valid IPv4 address or not.

Structure `numb3rs.py` as follows, wherein you’re welcome to modify
`main` and/or implement other functions as you see fit, but you may not
import any other libraries. You’re welcome, but not required, to use
`re` and/or `sys`.

``` python
import re
import sys


def main():
    print(validate(input("IPv4 Address: ")))


def validate(ip):
    ...


...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Either before or after you implement `validate` in `numb3rs.py`,
additionally implement, in a file called `test_numb3rs.py`, **two or
more** functions that collectively test your implementation of
`validate` thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with `test_` so
that you can execute your tests with:

``` highlight
pytest test_numb3rs.py
```

Hints

- Recall that the `re` module comes with
    quite a few functions, per
    [docs.python.org/3/library/re.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html),
    including `search`.
- Recall that regular expressions support
    quite a few special characters, per
    [docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax).
- Because backslashes in regular
    expressions could be mistaken for escape sequences (like `\n`), best
    to use [Python’s raw string notation for regular expression
    patterns](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re), else
    `pytest` will warn with
    `DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence`. Just as format
    strings are prefixed with `f`, so are raw strings prefixed with `r`.
    For instance, instead of `"harvard\.edu"`, use `r"harvard\.edu"`.
- Note that `re.search`, if passed a
    pattern with “capturing groups” (i.e., parentheses), returns a
    “match object,” per
    [docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects),
    wherein matches are 1-indexed, which you can access individually
    with `group`, per
    [docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.group](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.group),
    or collectively with `groups`, per
    [docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.groups](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.Match.groups).

## [Demo](#demo)

``` highlight
$ python numb3rs.py
IPv4 Address: 1.2.3.4
True
$ python numb3rs.py
IPv4 Address: 127.0.0.1
True
$ python numb3rs.py
IPv4 Address: 255.255.255.0
True
$ python numb3rs.py
IPv4 Address: 275.3.6.28
False
$ python numb3rs.py
IPv4 Address: cat
False
$
```

## [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin)

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window,
and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s
prompt resembles the below:

``` highlight
$
```

Next execute

``` highlight
mkdir numb3rs
```

to make a folder called `numb3rs` in your codespace.

Then execute

``` highlight
cd numb3rs
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal
prompt as `numb3rs/ $`. You can now execute

``` highlight
code numb3rs.py
```

to make a file called `numb3rs.py` where you’ll write your program. Be
sure to also execute

``` highlight
code test_numb3rs.py
```

to create a file called `test_numb3rs.py` where you’ll write tests for
your program.

## [How to Test](#how-to-test)

#### [How to Test `numb3rs.py`](#how-to-test-numb3rspy)

Here’s how to test `numb3rs.py` manually:

- Run your program with
    `python numb3rs.py`. Ensure your program prompts you for an IPv4
    address. Type `127.0.0.1`, followed by Enter. Your `validate`
    function should return `True`.
- Run your program with
    `python numb3rs.py`. Type `255.255.255.255`, followed by Enter. Your
    `validate` function should return `True`.
- Run your program with
    `python numb3rs.py`. Type `512.512.512.512`, followed by Enter. Your
    `validate` function should return `False`.
- Run your program with
    `python numb3rs.py`. Type `1.2.3.1000`, followed by Enter. Your
    `validate` function should return `False`.
- Run your program with
    `python numb3rs.py`. Type `cat`, followed by Enter. Your `validate`
    function should return `False`.

#### [How to Test `test_numb3rs.py`](#how-to-test-test_numb3rspy)

To test your tests, run `pytest test_numb3rs.py`. Try to use correct and
incorrect versions of `numb3rs.py` to determine how well your tests spot
errors:

- Ensure you have a correct version of
    `numb3rs.py`. Run your tests by executing `pytest test_numb3rs.py`.
    `pytest` should show that all of your tests have passed.
- Modify the `validate` function in the
    correct version of `numb3rs.py`. `validate` might, for example, only
    check whether the first byte of the IPv4 address is valid. Run your
    tests by executing `pytest test_numb3rs.py`. `pytest` should show
    that at least one of your tests has failed.
- Again modify the correct version of
    `numb3rs.py`. `validate` might, for example, mistakenly return
    `True` when the user inputs an incorrect IPv4 format. Run your tests
    by executing `pytest test_numb3rs.py`. `pytest` should show that at
    least one of your tests has failed.

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program
that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to
test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/numb3rs
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

``` highlight
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/numb3rs
