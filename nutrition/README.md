# [Nutrition Facts](#nutrition-facts)

The U.S. Food & Drug Adminstration (FDA) offers [downloadable/printable
posters](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-labeling-nutrition/nutrition-information-raw-fruits-vegetables-and-fish)
that “show nutrition information for the 20 most frequently consumed raw
fruits … in the United States. Retail stores are welcome to download the
posters, print, display and/or distribute them to consumers in close
proximity to the relevant foods in the stores.”

In a file called `nutrition.py`, implement a program that prompts
~~consumers~~ users to input a fruit (case-insensitively) and then
outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit, per the
[FDA’s poster for
fruits](Nutrition-Information-for-Raw-Fruits---small-PDF-Poster.pdf),
which is also [available as
text](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-labeling-nutrition/raw-fruits-poster-text-version-accessible-version).
Capitalization aside, assume that users will input fruits exactly as
written in the poster (e.g., `strawberries`, not `strawberry`). Ignore
any input that isn’t a fruit.

Hints

- Rather than use a conditional with 20 Boolean expressions, one for
  each fruit, better to use a `dict` to associate a fruit with its
  calories!
- If `k` is a `str` and `d` is a `dict`, you can check whether `k` is a
  key in `d` with code like:

  ``` py
  if k in d:
    ...
  ```

- Take care to output the fruit’s calories, not calories from fat!

## [Demo](#demo)

``` highlight
$ python nutrition.py
Item: apple
Calories: 130
$ python nutrition.py
Item: banana
Calories: 110
$ python nutrition.py
Item: chocolate
$
```

## [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin)

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window,
and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s
prompt resembles the below:

``` highlight
$
```

Next execute

``` highlight
mkdir nutrition
```

to make a folder called `nutrition` in your codespace.

Then execute

``` highlight
cd nutrition
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal
prompt as `nutrition/ $`. You can now execute

``` highlight
code nutrition.py
```

to make a file called `nutrition.py` where you’ll write your program.

## [How to Test](#how-to-test)

Here’s how to test your code manually:

- Run your program with `python nutrition.py`. Type `Apple` and press
  Enter. Your program should output:

  ``` highlight
  Calories: 130
  ```

- Run your program with `python nutrition.py`. Type `Avocado` and press
  Enter. Your program should output:

  ``` highlight
  Calories: 50
  ```

- Run your program with `python nutrition.py`. Type `Sweet Cherries` and
  press Enter. Your program should output

  ``` highlight
  Calories: 100
  ```

- Run your program with `python nutrition.py`. Type `Tomato` and press
  Enter. Your program should output nothing.

Be sure to try other fruits and vary the casing of your input. Your
program should behave as expected, case-insensitively.

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program
that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to
test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/nutrition
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

``` highlight
