# [Response Validation](#response-validation)

When creating a [Google Form](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) that
prompts users for a short answer (or paragraph), it’s possible to enable
[response validation](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3378864)
and require that the user’s input match a [regular
expression](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1371415). For instance,
you could require that a user input an email address with a regex like
[this
one](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#valid-e-mail-address):

``` highlight
^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+\/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$
```

Or you could more easily use Google’s built-in support for validating an
email address, per the screenshot below, much like you could use a
library in your own code:

![Google Form](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/7/response/form.png)

In a file called `response.py`, using either
[validator-collection](https://pypi.org/project/validator-collection/)
or [validators](https://github.com/kvesteri/validators) from PyPI,
implement a program that prompts the user for an email address via
`input` and then prints `Valid` or `Invalid`, respectively, if the input
is a syntatically valid email address. You may not use `re`. And do not
validate whether the email address’s domain name actually exists.

Hints

- Note that you can install
    validator-collection with:

    ``` highlight
    pip install validator-collection
    ```

    Click **Homepage** to find your way to the library’s documentation.

- Note that you can install validators
    with:

    ``` highlight
    pip install validators
    ```

    Click **Homepage** to find your way to the library’s documentation.

## [Demo](#demo)

``` highlight
$ python response.py
What's your email address? malan
Invalid
$ python response.py
What's your email address? malan at harvard dot edu
Invalid
$ python response.py
What's your email address? malan@harvard.edu
Valid
$
```

## [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin)

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window,
and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s
prompt resembles the below:

``` highlight
$
```

Next execute

``` highlight
mkdir response
```

to make a folder called `response` in your codespace.

Then execute

``` highlight
cd response
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal
prompt as `response/ $`. You can now execute

``` highlight
code response.py
```

to make a file called `response.py` where you’ll write your program.

## [How to Test](#how-to-test)

Here’s how to test your code manually:

- Run your program with
    `python response.py`. Ensure your program prompts you for an email,
    then type `malan@harvard.edu`, followed by Enter. Your program
    should output `Valid`.
- Run your program with
    `python response.py`. Type your own email, followed by Enter. Your
    program should output `Valid`.
- Run your program with
    `python response.py`. Type `malan@@@harvard.edu`, followed by Enter.
    Your program should output `Invalid`.
- Run your program with
    `python response.py`. Mistype your own email, including an extra `.`
    before `.com`, for example. Press enter and your program should
    output `Invalid`.

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program
that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to
test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/response
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

``` highlight
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/response
```
