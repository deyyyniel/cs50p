# [CS50 Shirtificate](#cs50-shirtificate)

Suppose that you’d like to implement a CS50 “shirtificate,” a PDF with
an image of an [I took
CS50](https://cs50.harvardshop.com/collections/print/products/i-took-cs50-unisex-t-shirt)
t-shirt, [shirtificate.png](shirtificate.png), customized with a user’s
own name.

In a file called `shirtificate.py`, implement a program that prompts the
user for their name and outputs, using
[fpdf2](https://pypi.org/project/fpdf2/), a CS50 shirtificate in a file
called `shirtificate.pdf` similar to [this one for John
Harvard](jharvard.pdf), with these specifications:

- The
    [orientation](https://py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/PageFormatAndOrientation.html)
    of the PDF should be Portrait.
- The
    [format](https://py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/PageFormatAndOrientation.html)
    of the PDF should be A4, which is 210mm wide by 297mm tall.
- The top of the PDF should say “CS50
    Shirtificate” as [text](https://py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/Text.html),
    centered horizontally.
- The shirt’s
    [image](https://py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/Images.html) should be
    centered horizontally.
- The user’s name should be on top of the
    shirt, in white
    [text](https://py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/TextStyling.html).

All other details we leave to you. You’re even welcome to add borders,
colors, and [lines](https://py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/Shapes.html#lines).
Your shirtificate needn’t match John Harvard’s precisely. And no need to
wrap long names across multiple lines.

Before writing any code, do read through fpdf2’s
[tutorial](https://py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/Tutorial.html) to learn how to
use it. Then skim fpdf2’s [API](https://py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/fpdf/)
(application programming interface) to see all of its functions and
parameters therefor.

No need to submit any PDFs with your code. But, if you would like,
you’re welcome (but not expected) to share a shirtificate with your name
on it in any of [CS50’s
communities](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/communities)!

Hints

- Note that fpdf2 comes with a `class`
    called `FPDF`, which has quite a few methods, per
    [py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/fpdf/#fpdf.FPDF](https://py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/fpdf/#fpdf.FPDF).
    You can install it with:

    ``` highlight
    pip install fpdf2
    ```

- Note that you can extend `FPDF` and
    instantiate your own subclass thereof in order to add a header to
    every page of a PDF, per
    [py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/Tutorial.html#tuto-2-header-footer-page-break-and-image](https://py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/Tutorial.html#tuto-2-header-footer-page-break-and-image).
    Or you can add it as text yourself.
- Note that you can disable automatic page
    breaks, which might otherwise cause your PDF to overflow from one
    page to two, with `set_auto_page_break`, per
    [py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/Margins.html](https://py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/Margins.html).
- Note that a
    [cell](https://py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/Text.html#cell)’s height can
    be negative, to move it upward.
- You can open `shirtificate.pdf`, once
    outputted, by clicking it in VS Code’s file explorer.

## [Demo](#demo)

``` highlight
$ python shirtificate.py                                                        
Name: John Harvard                                                              
$
```

## [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin)

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window,
and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s
prompt resembles the below:

``` highlight
$
```

Next execute

``` highlight
mkdir shirtificate
```

to make a folder called `shirtificate` in your codespace.

Then execute

``` highlight
cd shirtificate
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal
prompt as `shirtificate/ $`. Now execute

``` highlight
wget https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/8/shirtificate/shirtificate.png
```

to get a copy of the `shirtificate.png` image for your certificate.
Finally, execute

``` highlight
code shirtificate.py
```

to make a file called `shirtificate.py` where you’ll write your program.

## [How to Test](#how-to-test)

Here’s how to test your code manually:

- Run your program with `shirtificate.py`.
    Make sure your program prompts you for a name. Enter your own name
    and press Enter. Your program should create a file,
    `shirtificate.pdf`, containing the name you entered as input
    overlaid on a rendering of `shirtificate.png`.
- Try a few other names for good measure,
    too!

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program
that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to
test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/shirtificate
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

``` highlight
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/shirtificate
```
