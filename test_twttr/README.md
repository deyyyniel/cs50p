# [Testing my twttr](#testing-my-twttr)

In a file called `twttr.py`, reimplement [Setting up my
twttr](../../2/twttr/) from [Problem Set 2](../../2/), restructuring
your code per the below, wherein `shorten` expects a `str` as input and
returns that same `str` but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted,
whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

``` python
def main():
  ...


def shorten(word):
  ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

Then, in a file called `test_twttr.py`, implement **one or more**
functions that collectively test your implementation of `shorten`
thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with `test_` so that you
can execute your tests with:

``` python
pytest test_twttr.py
```

Hints

- Be sure to include

    ``` python
    import twttr
    ```

    or

    ``` python
    from twttr import shorten
    ```

    atop `test_twttr.py` so that you can call `shorten` in your tests.

- Take care to `return`, not `print`, a `str` in `shorten`. Only
    `main` should call `print`.

## [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin)

Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/), click on your terminal window,
and execute `cd` by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s
prompt resembles the below:

``` highlight
$
```

Next execute

``` highlight
mkdir test_twttr
```

to make a folder called `test_twttr` in your codespace.

Then execute

``` highlight
cd test_twttr
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal
prompt as `test_twttr/ $`. You can now execute

``` highlight
code test_twttr.py
```

to make a file called `test_twttr.py` where you’ll write your tests.

## [How to Test](#how-to-test)

To test your tests, run `pytest test_twttr.py`. Be sure you have a copy
of a `twttr.py` file in the same folder. Try to use correct and
incorrect versions of `twttr.py` to determine how well your tests spot
errors:

- Ensure you have a correct version of `twttr.py`. Run your tests by
    executing `pytest test_twttr.py`. `pytest` should show that all of
    your tests have passed.
- Modify the correct version of `twttr.py` in such a way as to create
    a bug. Your program might, for example, mistakenly only omit
    lowercase vowels! Run your tests by executing
    `pytest test_twttr.py`. `pytest` should show that at least one of
    your tests has failed.

You can execute the below to check your tests using `check50`, a program
CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. (Now there are tests to
test your tests!). Be sure to test your tests yourself and determine
which tests are needed to ensure `twttr.py` is checked thoroughly.

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/tests/twttr
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

``` highlight
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/tests/twttr
```
