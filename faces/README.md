# [Making Faces](#making-faces)

Before there were emoji, there were
[emoticons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons), whereby
text like `:)` was a happy face and text like `:(` was a sad face.
Nowadays, programs tend to convert emoticons to emoji automatically!

In a file called `faces.py`, implement a function called `convert` that
accepts a `str` as input and returns that same input with any `:)`
converted to ![🙂](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/1f642.png)
(otherwise known as a [slightly smiling
face](https://emojipedia.org/slightly-smiling-face/)) and any `:(`
converted to ![🙁](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/1f641.png)
(otherwise known as a [slightly frowning
face](https://emojipedia.org/slightly-frowning-face/)). All other text
should be returned unchanged.

Then, in that same file, implement a function called `main` that prompts
the user for input, calls `convert` on that input, and prints the
result. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly,
as by passing a `str` of your own as an argument to `input`. Be sure to
call `main` at the bottom of your file.

Hints

- Recall that `input` returns a `str`, per
  [docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input).
- Recall that a `str` comes with quite a few methods, per
  [docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).
- An emoji is actually just a character, so you can quote it like any
  `str`, a la
  `"`![`😐`](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/14.0.2/72x72/1f610.png)`"`.
  And you can copy and paste the emoji from this page into your own code
  as needed.

## [Before You Begin](#before-you-begin)

Execute `cd` by itself in your terminal window. You should find that
your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

``` highlight
$
```

Next execute

``` highlight
mkdir faces
```

to make a folder called `faces` in your codespace.

Then execute

``` highlight
cd faces
```

to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal
prompt as `faces/ $`. You can now execute

``` highlight
code faces.py
```

to make a file called `faces.py` where you’ll write your program.

## [Demo](#demo)

``` highlight
$ python faces.py
hello :)
hello 🙂
$ python faces.py
hello :(
hello 🙁
$
```

## [How to Test](#how-to-test)

Here’s how to test your code manually:

- Run your program with `python faces.py`. Type `Hello :)` and press
  Enter. Your program should output:

  ``` highlight
  Hello
  ```

- Run your program with `python faces.py`. Type `Goodbye :(` and press
  Enter. Your program should output:

  ``` highlight
  Goodbye
  ```

- Run your program with `python faces.py`. Type `Hello :) Goodbye :(`
  and press Enter. Your program should output

  ``` highlight
  Hello  Goodbye
  ```

You can execute the below to check your code using `check50`, a program
that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to
test it yourself as well!

``` highlight
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/faces
```

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will
indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that
`check50` outputs to see the input `check50` handed to your program,
what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

## [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

``` highlight
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/faces
```
